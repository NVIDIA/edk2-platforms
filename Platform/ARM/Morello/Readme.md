# Introduction

Morello is an ARMv8-A platform that implements the capability architecture
extension. Capability architecture specific changes will be added [here](https://git.morello-project.org/morello).

The platform port in UEFI firmware provides ARMv8-A architecture enablement.

Platform code is located at Platform/ARM/Morello.

The following platforms are supported

- Morello FVP
- Morello SoC

# Documentation

Further information on Morello Platform is available at this [page](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/cpu-architecture/a-profile/morello).

# Morello FVP

Morello FVP can be downloaded from this [location](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/arm-platforms-software/arm-ecosystem-fvps).

# Supported Host and Toolchain

- Host PC should be running Ubuntu Linux 24.04 LTS.
- Please refer to the `edk2-platforms/Readme.md` for downloading the GCC or Clang toolchain.

# Build Instructions

Please refer to the `edk2-platforms/Readme.md` for build instructions.

# Dependencies

The SCP will be the first to boot and will bring the AP core out of reset. The AP
core will start executing Trusted Firmware-A at BL1. BL1 authenticates and then loads
BL2 and starts executing it. BL2 authenticates and loads BL31. Once BL31 finishes
execution BL2 authenticates and loads BL33 (UEFI) and passes control to it.

The SCP and TF-A binaries are required to boot to the UEFI Shell.

## SCP Firmware

The SCP firmware source code can be downloaded from this [page](https://github.com/ARM-software/SCP-firmware).

Refer to the [SCP Readme](https://github.com/ARM-software/SCP-firmware/blob/master/user_guide.md)
for building SCP firmware.

## Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)

The Trusted Firmware-A source code can be downloaded from this [page](https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Refer to the [TF-A Readme](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/plat/arm/morello/index.rst) for building TF-A.
