  Device Tree Extension Protocol

  This protocol exposes the Qualcomm DTFramework device tree query APIs
  (node navigation, property access, and blob/overlay management) to DXE
  drivers.  It is a Qualcomm-specific protocol, not part of the UEFI or PI
  specifications.  During the PEI phase, BaseDtFrameworkLib populates a
  protocol instance backed by the DTFramework libfdt-style C functions and
  publishes it in a HOB; DtbExtnDxe consumes that HOB and installs the
  protocol so DXE-phase drivers can look up device tree nodes and
  properties without linking against DTFramework directly.
